      {
        q: 'What is the practical difference between a hydro stove and a ducted-air stove?',
        a: 'An air stove heats the air of the room it stands in, and can send part of it to two adjoining rooms if it is ducted. A hydro stove heats water, which it sends into your radiators or underfloor heating: it replaces or supplements a boiler. The first needs a flue and a power socket; the second also needs a hydraulic connection made by a professional.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Can you install the stove?',
        a: 'No. We sell the appliance, its documentation and its flue. Installation is a regulated trade that requires a local presence, and the connection determines whether your home insurance responds. Use a qualified installer near you — in France, an RGE qualification is also required for most public grants.',
      },
      {
        q: 'How much will I save compared with my current heating?',
        a: 'We do not give a figure, because an honest figure does not exist without knowing your real consumption, what you currently pay for energy, and the price of pellets in your area. All three move, the last one a great deal. The method is in our guides: take your annual consumption in kWh, divide by the efficiency of your current appliance, convert into kilos of pellets, and multiply by the price of a bag near you.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What is the delivery time?',
        a: 'Reckon on 2 to 5 business days to dispatch depending on the model, then 4 to 8 business days in transit within France, a little longer elsewhere in Europe. The exact figure is on each product page. The carrier calls you to agree a slot — a pallet cannot be left without someone there.',
      },
      {
        q: 'What if the appliance arrives damaged?',
        a: 'You write a precise reservation on the delivery note, in front of the driver, then email us with photographs within 48 hours. We take the carrier claim from there. Without a written reservation at the time of delivery, the claim becomes very difficult: that is why we insist on this point.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Can I return a stove that does not suit me?',
        a: 'Yes, within 14 days of receipt, under the right of withdrawal (Directive 2011/83/EU). The appliance must be uninstalled and repacked in its original packaging. Return costs are yours and, on a palletised appliance, they are high — which is why we would rather check the sizing before the order than after.',
      },
      {
        q: 'Does the stove work during a power cut?',
        a: 'No. The auger, the igniter and the flue-gas extractor are all electric: without power the appliance stops and the safety circuit trips. If cuts are frequent where you live, plan for a UPS sized for the extractor, or keep a back-up heat source that is independent of the grid.',
      },
      {
        q: 'How many pellets should I budget for a season?',
        a: 'The common order of magnitude is 1 to 2 tonnes a season for a 100 to 150 m² house, but the gap between those two figures is enormous and depends on your insulation, your target temperature and how hard the winter is. Start with one tonne and adjust in your second season using your own readings.',
